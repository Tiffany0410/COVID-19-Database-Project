# COVID-19-Database-Project

In this project, we investigated the impact of the pandemic on the U.S. in various aspects, including responding policies and stock markets, using the under-pandemic database. We also tried exploring the potential correlation between cases, deaths, and demographic factors of the States.

The ​questions​ we planned to investigate:
1. What are the states that have had any days with more than 100 new deaths per day both before and after June? What are their policies in response to the situation? Compare those stats with other states where the pandemic is mild.
2. Did the population and poverty level have a correlation with the coronavirus cases?
3. How does the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic directly impact the US overall economy, stock markets and labour market?
